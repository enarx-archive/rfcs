## Summary

This RFC describes the architecture adopted by Enarx for loading Wasm
packages into a prepared Keep using a secure channel. 

## Motivation

Once a Keep is prepared with shim, Wasm runtime, etc., the
tenant workload (Wasm binary + data) needs to be loaded into it.  A
description of the loading sequence is required.

## Tutorial

A Keep is the fundamental runtime component of Enarx: a TEE instance
+ Enarx runtime pieces, including WebAssembly and WASI layers.  In
order for the Keep to execute a workload, the Wasm (WebAssembly) package
that comprises the workload (binary/binaries + data elements) needs to be
loaded into the Keep.  This workload is sent to the Keep by the Enarx
Client Agent, encrypted under a session key (the workload provisioning
encryption key or WPEK) that is established at Keep provisioning time,
injected into the Empty Keep and communicated to the Enarx Client Agent
(see other RFCs for specifics). This WPEK is explicitly used to decrypt
the workload by the (Empty) Keep.

NOTE: this RFC does not include details of the specific steps required
for the exchange above, which includes other parties, including the
Enarx Host Agent, and host CPU + firmware.  See other RFCs for details.

The Keep has an agent running which is listening on a well-known port,
or on a port number previously established during the Keep preparation
phase.  The ECA connects to this port, and establishes a connection to
the Keep.  The Empty Keep receives the workload, decrypts it with the WPEK,
and runs it.

For this design to work, a route between the ECA and the Keep control
plane needs to be available.  Note that this does not necessarily
need to be direct: since an encrypted connection is not explicitly
required (see below), proxying is possible.  This could, if required,
be via an (untrusted) service on the host.

One of the Enarx project's design principles is that all network
and storage connections in and out of a Keep are encrypted.  In the
case of network connections, this usually means that the session is
encrypted using TLS (or dTLS), but since we may not have established
any certificates in the Keep at this point, it cannot act as the
server in a standard TLS client-server model, which requires
authentication of the party acting as the server. However, as the workload
provisioning encryption key (WPEK) is already available to
the Keep, if the workload can be decrypted using this key, this assures
the Keep that it is communicating with the ECA, or at least an entity
in the same trust domain, so identity has been confirmed, and
authentication is therefore implicit.

There are possible use cases where a Keep might wish to cache a copy
of the workload, either for reloading ("recycling" a Keep) or to
transfer to another Keep in the same trust domain.  This caching, if
under the origincal WPEK, is at the expense of Perfect Forward
Secrecy.  If a Keep is to transfer the workload to another Keep in
the same domain, the original Keep MAY encrypt the workload under a new
WPEK.  If the original WPEK is used, that WPEK will need to be
established in the new Keep either at provisioning time (e.g. by the
ECA) or at a later date through key negotiation.  Such functionality
is considered risky, as the key management required is difficult to
get right, and provides new options for compromise or
design/implementation errors.  Any design of such functionality requires
a new RFC (see "Future possibilities" below).

The Keep MUST NOT accept unencrypted workloads, as there is no way
to verify their provenance.
The Keep SHOULD listen on a well-known port (see "Unresolved
questions").
If a port has been pre-established, between the Enarx Client Agent and
the Keep, then the Keep MUST listen on this port,
and MAY also listen on the well-known port.
The Keep MAY cache the workload for re-use, or transfer to another
Keep.  If a Keep allows workloads to be used by another Keep, the
workload MAY be encrypted under a new WPEK, established between the
original Keep and new Keep.
Keeps MAY be implemented to enable the capability to perform
workload caching.
Enabling of the capability for a Keep to perform caching MUST be at
the discretion of the ECA or entities within the ECA's trust domain.
Enabling of the capability for a Keep to perform caching MUST NOT
be at the discretion of the host.  The host MUST NOT be able to
enable caching.

## Reference

This RFC arose from this issue: [Workload (WASM binary) loading
- connection termination](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/issues/140)

## Drawbacks

No drawbacks currently known. Furthermore, this mechanism is core functionality to Enarx.

## Rationale and alternatives

Alternatives considered:

Enarx client agent encrypts workload, sends to CPU/firmware via Enarx
host agent. CPU/firmware decrypts workload, loads into Keep. This has
the advantage that we use an existing network connection, and there's
no need to establish a connection nor a session key between the Keep
and the client agent.
Rejected: this is not supported by all architectures.

Enarx client agent encrypts workload, sends to host agent. Host agent
sends to Keep via a listening agent in the Keep. Keep decrypts, loads
and runs. This maintains the host agent's status as a proxy between
other components, and doesn't make further assumptions about routing
which is made by 2. 
Rejected:
- the host agent should act as an untrusted proxy wherever possible,
and not include process logic.
- maintaining multiple versions of host agents is complex from
a deployment point of view.

## Prior art

Some TEE implementations assume trust in the host system.  This is
explicitly excluded as one of the Enarx project's design principles.
In such implementations, a component trusted by the host system may
handle key management and decryption/loading of the workload.

## Unresolved questions

1. What should the well-known port number be?  Note that a number
above 1024 may make life a little easier (non-root binding).

Out of scope:
1. Keep preparation steps: requires RFC - issue #16.
1. Workload package format: requires RFC - issue #17.

## Implementations

No implementation yet available (2020-02-10).

## Future Possibilities

Caching designs should be considered under a new RFC.

There are opportunities for "pre-warmed" Keeps, which are provisioned
ahead of use time, and whose WPEK is not necessarily derived from the
initial session key established between the ECA and the waiting Keep.
Designs for such should be under a new RFC.
