## Summary

A description of the security vulnerability disclosure process, including embargoes.

## Motivation

Users and researchers who discover security issues in Enarx need to know that
we welcome their efforts and how we will manage their disclosure. They must
also be able to have an idea of how we use security embargoes.

In other words:
- We want:
  - to encourage reporting of security issues (ie: “Please do attack us!”)
  - to make it easy to report security issues
  - to maintain and extend our policy of safe defaults / discouraging people
  from adopting bad security practices
  - to recognise and show appreciation for the time spent researching and
  reporting
  - to make it possible for people who may be at risk to report issues
  pseudonymously

- We need:
  - a clear policy, describing both:
    - how to report; and
    - what to expect during the process
  - a main reporting channel:
    - secondary channels, should the main one fail/not be available/be
  overloaded.
  - a list of people who can be reached directly
  - a place to list security reports and give attribution


## Tutorial

This RFC aims to provide a set of documents (ex. wiki pages) that describe the 
Enarx vulnerability disclosure policy - including the use of embargos - and
the list of security advisories and fixes.

The two pages are "Vulnerability Reporting and Embargo Policy" and "Enarx 
Security Advisories."

### Vulnerability Reporting and Embargo Policy
The Enarx project aims to be as safe to use as possible and therefore to 
produce code that is as secure as possible. As such, we welcome any and all 
research into Enarx and appreciate your efforts to take the time to 
responsibly disclose any issues you find.

Vulnerabilities may be discovered in:
1. Enarx code
2. Enarx dependencies (including compilers)
3. Enarx documentation
4. 3rd party hardware or firmware

All security bugs in Enarx should be reported to the security team. 
To do so, please reach out either by email at security@enarx.dev or on our
[chat](https://chat.enarx.dev) stating you'd like to report a security
issue, but **without divulging details**.

We treat both email and chat as a public channels, so simply saying that
you’re trying to get a hold of someone from the security team is fine.

From then, we will establish a more secure area where the issue can be
discussed, in the form of a 
[Github Security Advisory](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories).

You will be invited to join this private area to discuss specifics. Doing so 
allows us to start with a high level of confidentiality and relax it if the 
issue is less critical, moving to work on the fix in the open.

This method provides several other advantages:
1. Avoids email, which is unfortunately very difficult to use securely
2. Enables private collaboration to fix the vulnerability in 
a temporary private fork
3. Facilitates drafting a security advisory and using the draft to 
privately discuss the impact of the vulnerability on the project
4. Simplifies publishing the security advisory and alerting the 
community of the vulnerability

Your initial contact will be acknowledged within 48 hours, and you’ll receive 
a more detailed response within 96 hours indicating the next steps in handling 
your report.

After the initial reply to your report, the security team  will endeavor to 
keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full 
announcement. As recommended by 
[RFPolicy](https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/general/rfpolicy-2.0.txt),
 these updates will be sent at least every five working days.

If you have not received a reply to your initial contact within 96 hours, or
have not heard from the security team for the past five days, there are a few
steps you can take (in suggested order):
- Contact the current security coordinator (Nathaniel McCallum, aka
[npmccallum](https://github.com/npmccallum)) directly
- Contact the back-up contact (Mike Bursell, aka 
[MikeCamel](https://github.com/mikecamel)) directly  
  In both these cases, you can reach out
  - by email
  - by chat
- Contact the team as a whole on the [chat](https://chat.enarx.dev).

As a reminder, **when escalating in these venues, please do not discuss your
issue.** 

Lastly, should you need to transfer files to us in a private manner, please 
use [Magic Wormhole](https://magic-wormhole.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or 
make them available over https.


#### Disclosure policy
The Enarx project has a 5 step disclosure process.
1. Contact is established, a private channel created, and the security report 
is received and is assigned a primary handler. 
  This person will coordinate the fix and release process.
2. The problem is confirmed and a list of all affected versions is determined.
  2.1 If an embargo is needed (see below), details of the embargo are decided.
3. Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
4. Fixes are prepared for all releases which are still under maintenance. 
  4.1 In case of embargo, these fixes are not committed to the public 
  repository but rather held in a private fork pending the announcement.
5. The changes are pushed to the public repository and new builds are deployed.
  An announcement is sent to Enarx public channels (chat, website), once
  these are available.

This process can take some time, especially when coordination is required 
with maintainers of other projects or, for instance, with hardware vendors. 
Every effort will be made to handle the bug in as timely a manner as possible, 
however it is important that we follow the release process above to ensure 
that the disclosure is handled in a consistent manner.

Enarx does not provide financial rewards for security disclosures, but the 
team is open to working with reporters of issues on publishing and attribution 
of vulnerabilities and fixes. We welcome reports of issues to the project, 
and want to ensure that the community is aware of and celebrates security 
improvements.

#### Embargoes
While the Enarx project aims to follow the highest standards of transparency 
and openness (cf. [Enarx Principles](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/wiki/Design-principles)), 
handling some security issues may pose such an immediate threat to various 
stakeholders and require coordination between various actors that it cannot 
be made immediately public.

In this case, security issues will fall under an embargo.

An embargo can be called for in various cases:
- when disclosing the issue without simultaneously providing a mitigation 
  would seriously endanger users,
- when producing a fix requires coordinating between multiple actors (such as
   upstream or downstream/dependency projects), or simply
- when proper analysis of the issue and its ramifications demands time.

If we determine that an issue you report requires an embargo, we will discuss 
this with you and try to find a reasonable expiry date (aka “embargo 
completion date”), as well as who should be included in the list of 
need-to-know people.

In any case, embargoes are a process that should be used sparingly, as they 
are painful and time-consuming.

For more information about embargoes and vulnerability disclosure, you can 
refer to [this article](https://aliceevebob.com/2018/01/09/meltdown-and-spectre-thinking-about-embargoes-and-disclosures).

Lastly, in no way should an embargo be understood as a means to avoid making 
Enarx faults public. Transparency is paramount to the Enarx project.

### Enarx Security Advisories
This page lists all security advisories, vulnerabilities and fixes in Enarx 
itself.

For security issues, vulnerabilities and fixes in underlying TEEs, both in 
SDKs and in hardware, please refer to our 
[page on the subject](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/wiki/TEEs-vulnerabilities-and-attacks/).

If you think you have found a security issue with Enarx, we encourage you to 
report it.
To do so, you may follow the process described in the 
[Vulnerability Disclosure and Embargo Policy](https://github.com/enarx/enarx/wiki/Vulnerability-disclosure-and-embargo-policy) page.

## Reference

Much of this RFC is inspired by the [Rust Security Policy](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security),
as well as [RFPolicy 2.0](https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/general/rfpolicy-2.0.txt), 
to which it refers.

## Drawbacks

- This process opts for a "secret by default" approach, as any security issue 
reported will automatically be in a private area. This may seem at odds with 
our goal of transparency. We may need a clear set of criteria according to 
which we make a security report public rather than go for / maintain an embargo.

## Rationale and alternatives

- The most basic alternative is not to have a policy and to simply wait for
people to disclose their findings. This does nothing to provide guarantees 
to researchers and users that their work and time will be respected and to 
encourage further disclosures.  We do not believe that such an approach would be consistent with the transparency and openness goals of the Enarx project.
- Offer full reporting of security vulnerabilities by email, as many other 
projects do, and which is what many researchers will be used to.  
However, encrypted email is not a good solution. The only usable standard for 
encrypted email is OpenPGP, which suffers from very poor usability, offers no 
Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and imposes complex and painful key management 
on the recipients as well as the senders. Cf. [this analysis](https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html), 
for more insights.

## Prior art

Rust process mentioned above.

## Unresolved questions
Can this process be seen as contradictory with our intention to minimise the 
use of embargo, and can we make clearer that we don't intend to make every 
security report secret?

## Implementations

N/A

## Future Possibilities

We could offer further official channels for secure communication and
disclosure.

Some ideas are:
- Github: work with Github on security issues reporting (WIP)
- Use RocketChat, our current [chat platform](https://chat.enarx.dev)  RocketChat's capacity for with end-to-end 
  encryptted conversations.
- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/encrypt) messaging
- [Signal](https://signal.org): raises question which account (ie: phone number)
- A OMEMO or OTR enabled Jabber / XMPP account (OMEMO offering the advantage 
  of allowing to establish a secure channel without both participants being 
  online)
- [Secure Drop](https://securedrop.org/) (initially designed for as a way to 
  share and accept documents securely for news organisations, likely overkill)
- A simpler drop box over HTTPS
